- # 01 Propose
  Recently, you can check your health status through a smartwatch. The smartwatch Fitbit has the advantage of being able to store the heart rate per minute in Excel through developer mode and can be used for more than a week on a single charge. Using this function, I would like to analyze the heart rate.
